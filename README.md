# Experimental UI for Automated Retail Software

This project showcases an experimental UI design for automated retail software. It's designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and interacting with a retail bot.

## Technology

The UI is built using SvelteKit and TypeScript, which makes for a highly responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Usage

To use this UI, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gwkline/sveltekit-gk.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The UI will then be accessible at `localhost:5173`.

Please note that this UI is designed to be connected to a bot's backend. However, some seed data has been provided to showcase the components.

## Feedback

This project was built without a designer and with almost no prior knowledge of Svelte/Sveltekit, so any and all feedback is welcome. Whether you're a user, a developer, or just someone interested in the project, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
